# React-app-mess

I was trying some things out while learning react and typescript     
Then I messed up by changing the code location in a file     
# ðŸ’¨The messed up files are:     
app.tsk      
ListGroup.tsx
     
  I was reffering to this video by Mosh => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk&t=3755s     


Update: There is a problem uploading the node modules, I will sort this till soon.
